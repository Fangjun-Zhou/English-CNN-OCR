##9: Subjective grade of the quality of the project in comparison to other students' submission. (8/10);;;;There's sufficient comments explaining what I did with the code. The result accuracy is acceptable. I think the quality is not bad, but also not the best of all. I think I should save the data augmentation part I wrote. But since it was too slow, I finally deleted it.;;;;Subjective grade of the difficulty of the project in comparison with P1 to P5. (7/10);;;;This is just a small project that I want to develop, and is not different from the original object classfication CNN on tensorflow website. So I don't think the work I've done is difficult.;;;;Subjective grade of the creativity of the project. (6/10);;;;Character classification is not fancy at all. And I want to say that this is only part of the project I'm planing to work on. What I wanted to develop is a R-CNN network with character detection. But I searched for some paper about R-CNN, and not able to figure out how to develop a region proposal network with region correction in CNN output layer. So I just made this basic CNN.
